## ðŸ”’ Security Highlights

This script implements advanced security best practices:

- **Secrets never exported globally**: Credentials are scoped to temporary subshells.
- **No hardcoded paths**: All system paths and file locations are variables.
- **Trap cleanup**: Temporary files are securely deleted on exit or interruption.
- **Secure temp directories**: Created with `mktemp -d` and `chmod 700`.
- **Strict input validation**: Domains, emails, Docker container names, and API tokens validated safely.
- **Injection prevention**: All user inputs are safely sanitized.
- **AWS credentials**: Permissions validated dynamically and corrected if needed.
- **Centralized logging**: Logs actions (not secrets) into a secured `pihole-https-setup.log` file.
