## 🔫 Welcome to the Show

So, you’ve got a Pi-hole. Congratulations, you’ve taken your first step toward *not* being followed by a thousand ad trackers. But are you browsing your Pi-hole dashboard over HTTP like a total peasant? Stop it. Seriously.

This script, makes it *stupid easy* to secure your Pi-hole with HTTPS using Let's Encrypt, DNS validation, and the magical powers of `acme.sh`. Works with both regular and Docker Pi-hole setups because inclusivity matters.

---
> TL;DR: Run a script. Get SSL. Feel fancy. Maybe cry tears of joy. Or frustration. Depends on your DNS provider.

## 🔍 Overview

You want HTTPS. I want tacos. Let’s meet in the middle.

This script automagically sets up HTTPS on your Pi-hole admin interface using Let’s Encrypt and DNS validation — even if your Pi-hole is chilling behind a NAT like it’s hiding from John Wick.

It works on bare metal, in Docker, and possibly in the Quantum Realm (not tested).

---

## ✨ Features (Cue Drumroll)
- 💥 One-command HTTPS setup
- 🧙 DNS validation with *eight* mystical DNS providers
- 🐳 Docker support, because containerization is sexy
- 🔄 Auto-renewal, because remembering things is for chumps
- 🔐 ECC certs because... math
- 🧑‍🎤 Interactive setup wizard that holds your hand like a scared raccoon

---

## 📋 Prerequisites
Before we ride this unicorn, you’ll need:
- A working Pi-hole (duh)
- A domain or subdomain aimed squarely at your Pi-hole
- DNS provider API creds (no stealing!)
- A bash shell and `curl` installed
- Enough permission mojo to mess with your Pi-hole config

---

## 🔒 Supported DNS Providers
We got ‘em all. Well, at least the cool ones:

- Cloudflare (bring your API token, not your drama)
- Namecheap (username, API key, source IP… and a love letter)
- GoDaddy (key + secret = 🔓)
- AWS Route53 (keys or credential files, you choose your poison)
- DigitalOcean (token, please)
- Linode (yep, also token)
- Google Cloud DNS (service account JSON file — it’s a party)
- deSEC (token, once again)

---

## 💻 Installation (aka CTRL+C this stuff)
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrimePoobah/piholev6-ssl-setup/main/piholev6-ssl-setup.sh
chmod +x piholev6-ssl-setup.sh
./piholev6-ssl-setup.sh
```

---

## 🚀 Usage (Do the Thing)
When you run this magnificent beast:
1. It detects Docker (because it’s psychic)
2. Asks for your domain (e.g., `pihole.yourcooldomain.com`)
3. Gets your email (for Let's Encrypt. No spam. Probably.)
4. Asks which DNS god you worship
5. Collects your API soul… I mean credentials
6. Installs `acme.sh` if it’s slacking
7. Gets your certificate 🎉
8. Configures Pi-hole to use it
9. Sets up auto-renewal so you can forget this ever happened

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Options
No YAML, no BS. It’ll ask you things like:
- Your domain
- Your email
- Your DNS provider
- Your API credentials

You answer. It obeys. Like a good intern.

---

## 🐳 Docker Support
Using Docker? You Rockstar. No problem.

- It asks for your container name (`pihole` by default, don’t be a maverick)
- Copies certs into the container
- Tells Pi-hole to behave with HTTPS
- Hooks into renewals like a cybernetic octopus

Example nerd-fu:
```bash
docker cp /path/to/tls.pem pihole:/etc/pihole/tls.pem
docker exec pihole pihole-FTL --config webserver.domain your-domain.com
docker exec pihole service pihole-FTL restart
```

---

## 🔄 Automatic Certificate Renewal
Because who wants to do anything manually?

This script:
- Sets a cron job to check every 60 days-ish
- Renews when it’s close to expiry
- Installs the new cert
- Restarts `pihole-FTL` like a champ

Manual override?
```bash
~/.acme.sh/acme.sh --renew -d your-domain.com --force
```

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting (aka Crap Hit the Fan)
**Can’t get a cert?**
- Check your DNS API creds
- Verify your DNS settings
- Sacrifice a virtual goat? (not required, but might help)

**HTTPS not working?**
- Check your files: `ls -l /etc/pihole/tls.pem`
- Read the logs: `sudo systemctl status pihole-FTL`
- Verify DNS is pointed correctly

**Docker crying?**
- Check your container name
- Verify paths
- Read those juicy `docker logs pihole`

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations
Because I care about your bits:
- API creds are stored *temporarily*
- Docker copies are done internally
- Only give API tokens the bare minimum rights
- Use restricted service accounts if you’re an AWS/Google ninja
